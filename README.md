👋 Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm [Ganesh Jatavath], currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering at **_NIT Calicut_**. I have a profound passion for _**CAD and CAE**_, particularly specializing in **_chassis and suspension design_**. As a dedicated member of the automobile club _** Team Unwired**_, I've honed my skills in applying theoretical knowledge to practical automotive engineering challenges.

Beyond mechanical engineering, I'm a tech enthusiast with a strong affinity for **_JavaScript, frontend web development, and Python programming_**. I find joy in crafting intuitive user interfaces and exploring the endless possibilities of web technologies.

My GitHub repositories showcase my journey through projects ranging from CAD designs of innovative chassis systems to interactive web applications. I believe in leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and am eager to contribute to collaborative projects that push boundaries.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me. Let's innovate and build together!
